In this chapter, we discussed our approach to solve the problem of motion planning for omnidirectional robot in dynamic robot soccer environment. First, discuss our approach to simplify the geometry and dynamics of the robots. Then, we derive the fixed-state free-final-time controller for double integrator model. After that, we extend the collision-checking algorithm in the previous chapter to deal with trajectory and moving obstacle. Then, we discuss stochastic decision to directly sampling the goal state. After that, we discuss our implementation of kinodynamic-RRT* algorithm with double integrator model in dynamic environment. Then we describe our motion planning strategy. After that, we discuss trajectory tracking control used in this work to follow the planned trajectory. Finally, we describe our approach for online computation of motion planning and trajectory tracking.
